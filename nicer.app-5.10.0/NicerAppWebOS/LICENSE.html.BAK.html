    <li>Add all computer languages to <a href="https://nicer.app/NicerAppWebOS/documentation/NicerApp-WebOS--todoList--v5.y.z.php" target="naGithubTodoPrint">https://nicer.app/NicerAppWebOS/documentationn/NicerApp-WebOS--todoList--v5.y.z.php</a> <a href="https://nicer.app/todo">(in WebOS view, https://nicer.app/todo)</a></li>

    <li>This software is currently in Alpha-to-Beta phase. That means while most of the features work, <br/>
	there probably are still some undiscovered bugs to fix, and incomplete or concept future component outlines.</li>
    <li>ALL CODE ON <a target="naGithub2" href="HTTPS://github.com/NicerEnterprises">HTTPS://github.com/NicerEnterprises</a> AND ALL DERIVATIVES STORED ANYWHERE IN ANY WAY, <br/>
	*MUST* INCLUDE THIS ENTIRE LICENSE FILE AND BE HAND-SIGNED WITH YOUR NAME, PUBLIC PRIMARY EMAIL ADDRESS, <br/>
	AND BE PUBLICLY ACCESSIBLE THROUGH SOME QUALITY 'git' CLOUDHOSTING ANYWHERE ON WHATEVER NETWORK HUMANITY IS USING.</li>
    <li>For more information, please email me for price quotes, as all NicerApp installations will need to be (initially) supervised by me myself.<br/>
    For those who know coding (one of my target audiences), you can try to get it up and running yourself. At github, you'll find detailed README files that are kept up to date with the <a href="kubuntu.com" target="kubuntuOS" class="nomod noPushState">free Kubuntu.com OS</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Pricing</h1>
<p>
This software company will NEVER EVER be available for buy-out or hostile take-over, however going to a stock exchange with it (a partial sell-out at around 20% of the Company's total income-value or somethings; that's something I have yet to investigate), might one day become an option for me.
</p>
<ul>
    <li style="position:relative; overflow-x:overflow-wrap: break-word;">Big-tech : 500 million customers or more world-wide : 1% of earnings per tax-year.</li>

<h1>NO MORE COMMERCIAL INSTALLATIONS WITHOUT MUTUALLY SIGNED CONTRACT</h1>
<p>
In the past, i've offered many free installations, only to see the principles of my design totally stolen by Big Tech and Government Tech Companies.<br/>
I hereby claim the right to Legal Self-Defense against any of that.<br/>
</p>

This Software is free for governmental, non-profit, and educational use only (for now).<br/>
