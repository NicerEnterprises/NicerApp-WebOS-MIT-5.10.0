        What do you get when you put a grown up man in a weekly recurring fight over meeting his basic consumption needs by refusing a simple and most of all stable solution for that huge problem?<br/>
        A very pissed off man..<br/>
        Angry enough to kill others who are better off.<br/>
        And believe me, it would be completely justified; at least according to Karmatic Law.<br/>
        You're all very lucky it'll take "only" 19.5 hours more for me to get paid a basic living wage again, folks.<br/>
        Me? I just get disgruntled. And I'm not evil enough to explain in underground ways how to kill many others.<br/>
        But it would not take much for the lines to be drawn more lethally.<br/>
        However, when I talk about my own plans; If I even end my own life prematurely, I have always planned an exit by peaceful suicide first and foremost. I don't hate *everyone*, far from it in fact.<br/>
