                Getting <a href="https://said.by/me"  class="nomod noPushState" target="sbMe">said.by/me</a> up and running wasn't easy, but the final fix for it's window (dialog) display coordinate calculator was (in hindsight).<br/>
                The rest of the fixes will happen over the coming weekend and week(s), well in time for that Dec 1st deadline.
