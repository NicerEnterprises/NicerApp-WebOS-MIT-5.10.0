                Well, Mark Levin with his usually too nationalistic for my taste show on Fox News US, had a guest today, Ben Shappiro, who explains in his new book 'lions and scavengers' how society-builders (lions) often have to compete with scavengers in frustrating ways [or something to that extent, i was groggy from just stepping out of bed when i heard that].<br/>
                And it immediately struck a chord in my mind and heart; I'm a builder myself, both in my commercial work as in my peace activism.<br/>
                I'll just accept poverty during the buildup of my own company, you won't hear me complaining about poverty stricken weekends anymore.
